First of all, since we couldn't think of a way to predict disasters; properly managing one seemed like the best option
Since everyone has mobile phones, a mobile app becomes the best option to reach maximum no of people 
Moreover, since most people aren't going to open this app unless it's the first time they have installed it or a disaster strikes(we actually 
have an idea to change this; we'll come to that in a little while) making the app memory efficient becomes very important(people wouldn't like 
to have an app that occupies a lot of space and they don't even use it very often).

Now for the main idea:

We said that people won't open this app very often and that is because they have no incentive to. It is much more rewarding for the brain to open a 
social media app or a gaming app; so practically speaking, this app won't really be used as much in day to day life, UNLESS
we add another feature which allows people to take part in a trivia game, themed around hadling disaster situations, competing against people in 
the same region, winning currency prizes like many applications out today and questions majorly related to disasters occurring in that region.
This will incentivise people to use that app along with providing information as to how to deal with difficult situations; subtly feeding all this information
into the users' brains; preparing them for what they might not otherwise be prepared for.

Another feature we thought might be useful is the availability of offline information that can prove to be a life saver in time of crisis.
Moreover if the information is customised for people in different regions it can prove to be even more useful, filtering out information that might not be needed. 
When the user first installs the app, we ask for his/her location
On the basis of that and various maps which show the likeliness of a disaster striking there(through 
maps like https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/India_earthquake_zone_map_en.svg  ; different maps devoted to different disasters)
Now, once the user is aware of the risks associated with that location, he/she will be directed to a screen that has a list of those disasters and under each
one, one can find information(and if possible, videos) as to where to find and arrange the basic needs such as water, food, shelter etc. in case of a 
disaster; all of which can be downloaded(because they won't have network access when a disaster strikes); also a general file containing information as
to how to deal with different injuries will automatically be downloaded (with optional download of videos for assistance) as injuries can occur irrespective
of kind of disaster.
This information will enable them to survive till help arrives.
